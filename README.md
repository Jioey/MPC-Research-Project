# Description
Inspired by Dr. Krystof Onak's paper *Round Compression for Parallel Matching Algorithms*, I am working with him to implement maximum matching algorithms based on the [Massively Parallel Computing Algorithm](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/papers/MPC-Tutorial.pdf) (See Section 2.1 on pg. 346 for definition).  

This is a year long directive study for BU's CS Honors program. My topic proposal can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EBOpWb7zEYg3D6mrU3V24DN729dCXt7a/view?usp=sharing)
